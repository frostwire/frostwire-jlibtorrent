/**
 * You will usually have to store your torrent handles somewhere, since it's
 * the object through which you retrieve information about the torrent and
 * aborts the torrent.
 * <p>
 * .. warning::
 * Any member function that returns a value or fills in a value has to be
 * made synchronously. This means it has to wait for the main thread to
 * complete the query before it can return. This might potentially be
 * expensive if done from within a GUI thread that needs to stay
 * responsive. Try to avoid querying for information you don't need, and
 * try to do it in as few calls as possible. You can get most of the
 * interesting information about a torrent from the
 * torrent_handle::status() call.
 * <p>
 * The default constructor will initialize the handle to an invalid state.
 * Which means you cannot perform any operation on it, unless you first
 * assign it a valid handle. If you try to perform any operation on an
 * uninitialized handle, it will throw ``invalid_handle``.
 * <p>
 * .. warning::
 * All operations on a torrent_handle may throw libtorrent_exception
 * exception, in case the handle is no longer referring to a torrent.
 * There is one exception is_valid() will never throw. Since the torrents
 * are processed by a background thread, there is no guarantee that a
 * handle will remain valid between two calls.

     * If one file has been modified when the torrent is added again, the

     * cache before saving the resume data. This will make sure that the

     * the resume data. The recommended way to do this is to pause the
     * torrent, which will flush the cache and disconnect all peers.
     * <p>
     * .. note::
     * It is typically a good idea to save resume data whenever a torrent
     * is completed or paused. In those cases you don't need to pause the
     * torrent or the session, since the torrent will do no more writing to
     * its files. If you save resume data for torrents when they are
     * paused, you can accelerate the shutdown process by not saving resume
     * data again for paused torrents. Completed torrents should have their
     * resume data saved when they complete and on exit, since their
     * statistics might be updated.
     * <p>
     * In full allocation mode the reume data is never invalidated by
     * subsequent writes to the files, since pieces won't move around. This
     * means that you don't need to pause before writing resume data in full
     * or sparse mode. If you don't, however, any data written to disk after
     * you saved resume data and before the session closed is lost.
     * <p>
     * It also means that if the resume data is out dated, libtorrent will
     * not re-check the files, but assume that it is fairly recent. The
     * assumption is that it's better to loose a little bit than to re-check
     * the entire file.
     * <p>
     * It is still a good idea to save resume data periodically during
     * download as well as when closing down.

     * downloading to. If the given {@code savePath} is not located on the same
     * drive as the original save path, the files will be copied to the new
     * drive and removed from their original location. This will block all
     * other disk IO, and other torrents download and upload rates may drop
     * while copying the file.
     * <p>
     * Since disk IO is performed in a separate thread, this operation is
     * also asynchronous. Once the operation completes, the
     * {@link com.frostwire.jlibtorrent.alerts.StorageMovedAlert} is generated,
     * with the new path as the message. If the move fails for some reason,
     * {@link com.frostwire.jlibtorrent.alerts.StorageMovedFailedAlert}
     * generated instead, containing the error message.
     * <p>
     * The {@code flags} argument determines the behavior of the copying/moving
     * of the files in the torrent. see move_flags_t.
     * <p>
     * * always_replace_files = 0
     * * fail_if_exist = 1
     * * dont_replace = 2
     * <p>
     * ``always_replace_files`` is the default and replaces any file that
     * exist in both the source directory and the target directory.
     * <p>
     * ``fail_if_exist`` first check to see that none of the copy operations
     * would cause an overwrite. If it would, it will fail. Otherwise it will
     * proceed as if it was in ``always_replace_files`` mode. Note that there
     * is an inherent race condition here. If the files in the target
     * directory appear after the check but before the copy or move
     * completes, they will be overwritten. When failing because of files
     * already existing in the target path, the ``error`` of
     * ``move_storage_failed_alert`` is set to
     * ``boost::system::errc::file_exists``.
     * <p>
     * The intention is that a client may use this as a probe, and if it
     * fails, ask the user which mode to use. The client may then re-issue
     * the ``move_storage`` call with one of the other modes.
     * <p>
     * ``dont_replace`` always takes the existing file in the target
     * directory, if there is one. The source files will still be removed in
     * that case.
     * <p>
     * Files that have been renamed to have absolute pahts are not moved by
     * this function. Keep in mind that files that don't belong to the
     * torrent but are stored in the torrent's directory may be moved as
     * well. This goes for files that have been renamed to absolute paths
     * that still end up inside the save path.
