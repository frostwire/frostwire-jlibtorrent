/**
 * You will usually have to store your torrent handles somewhere, since it's
 * the object through which you retrieve information about the torrent and

 * <p>
 * .. warning::
 * Any member function that returns a value or fills in a value has to be
 * made synchronously. This means it has to wait for the main thread to
 * complete the query before it can return. This might potentially be
 * expensive if done from within a GUI thread that needs to stay
 * responsive. Try to avoid querying for information you don't need, and
 * try to do it in as few calls as possible. You can get most of the
 * interesting information about a torrent from the
 * torrent_handle::status() call.
 * <p>
 * The default constructor will initialize the handle to an invalid state.
 * Which means you cannot perform any operation on it, unless you first
 * assign it a valid handle. If you try to perform any operation on an
 * uninitialized handle, it will throw ``invalid_handle``.
 * <p>
 * .. warning::
 * All operations on a torrent_handle may throw libtorrent_exception
 * exception, in case the handle is no longer referring to a torrent.
 * There is one exception is_valid() will never throw. Since the torrents
 * are processed by a background thread, there is no guarantee that a
 * handle will remain valid between two calls.

     * ``save_resume_data()`` generates fast-resume data and returns it as an
     * entry. This entry is suitable for being bencoded. For more information
     * about how fast-resume works, see fast-resume_.
     * <p>
     * The ``flags`` argument is a bitmask of flags ORed together. see
     * save_resume_flags_t
     * <p>
     * This operation is asynchronous, ``save_resume_data`` will return
     * immediately. The resume data is delivered when it's done through an
     * save_resume_data_alert.
     * <p>
     * The fast resume data will be empty in the following cases:
     * <p>
     * 1. The torrent handle is invalid.
     * 2. The torrent is checking (or is queued for checking) its storage, it
     * will obviously not be ready to write resume data.
     * 3. The torrent hasn't received valid metadata and was started without
     * metadata (see libtorrent's metadata-from-peers_ extension)
     * <p>
     * Note that by the time you receive the fast resume data, it may already
     * be invalid if the torrent is still downloading! The recommended
     * practice is to first pause the session, then generate the fast resume
     * data, and then close it down. Make sure to not remove_torrent() before
     * you receive the save_resume_data_alert though. There's no need to
     * pause when saving intermittent resume data.
     * <p>
     * .. warning::
     * If you pause every torrent individually instead of pausing the
     * session, every torrent will have its paused state saved in the
     * resume data!
     * <p>
     * .. warning::
     * The resume data contains the modification timestamps for all files.
     * If one file has been modified when the torrent is added again, the
     * will be rechecked. When shutting down, make sure to flush the disk
     * cache before saving the resume data. This will make sure that the
     * file timestamps are up to date and won't be modified after saving
     * the resume data. The recommended way to do this is to pause the
     * torrent, which will flush the cache and disconnect all peers.
     * <p>
     * .. note::
     * It is typically a good idea to save resume data whenever a torrent
     * is completed or paused. In those cases you don't need to pause the
     * torrent or the session, since the torrent will do no more writing to
     * its files. If you save resume data for torrents when they are
     * paused, you can accelerate the shutdown process by not saving resume
     * data again for paused torrents. Completed torrents should have their
     * resume data saved when they complete and on exit, since their
     * statistics might be updated.
     * <p>
     * In full allocation mode the reume data is never invalidated by
     * subsequent writes to the files, since pieces won't move around. This
     * means that you don't need to pause before writing resume data in full
     * or sparse mode. If you don't, however, any data written to disk after
     * you saved resume data and before the session closed is lost.
     * <p>
     * It also means that if the resume data is out dated, libtorrent will
     * not re-check the files, but assume that it is fairly recent. The
     * assumption is that it's better to loose a little bit than to re-check
     * the entire file.
     * <p>
     * It is still a good idea to save resume data periodically during
     * download as well as when closing down.
     * <p>
     * Example code to pause and save resume data for all torrents and wait
     * for the alerts:
     * <p>
     * .. code:: c++
     * <pre>
