## 🚀 Next Steps After Merging

### 1. Read the Checklist
**⚠️ START HERE:** `POST_MERGE_CHECKLIST.md`

### 2. For Next Release
When creating a GitHub release, upload these additional files:
- `jlibtorrent-{version}-sources.jar` (NEW)
- `jlibtorrent-{version}-javadoc.jar` (NEW)

These are already generated by the build in `build/libs/`

### 3. GitHub Action
Run the "Publish Java Package" workflow as usual - it now downloads and publishes sources/javadoc automatically

### 4. Deployment Script
Run the updated script on your Maven host:
```bash
export GITHUB_PAT="your_token"
deploy_jlibtorrent_maven_release.sh 2.0.12.5
```

## 🎓 What You Should Know

### The Problem
Only JAR and POM files were published. Users couldn't see source code or javadoc in their IDEs.

### The Solution
Modified the publish workflow and build configuration to also publish sources and javadoc JARs.

### The Implementation
- Workflow downloads sources/javadoc from releases
- Gradle publishes them with proper Maven classifiers
- Deployment script syncs them to custom Maven host

### The Result
Users can now see source code and documentation directly in their IDEs when using jlibtorrent.
